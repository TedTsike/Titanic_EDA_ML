# Titanic_EDA_ML 
Titanic Survival Prediction - EDA & Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **Logistic Regression model** to predict survival outcomes.  
It demonstrates key **data science skills** like:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**
- **Model Evaluation**

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **[Datascience Dojo's GitHub](https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets)** and contains information on Titanic passengers, including **age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status**.

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run
Clone this repository and run the Python script:

git clone https://github.com/TedTsike/Titanic-EDA-ML.git
cd Titanic-EDA-ML
python Titanic_EDA_ML.py
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We use Seaborn & Matplotlib to explore survival patterns:

✔️Survival Count Plot
✔️Age Distribution by Survival
✔️Feature Correlations


## Machine Learning Model
We implemented Logistic Regression to predict survival:
Feature Engineering: Categorical encoding, missing value imputation, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Split data into training (80%) and test (20%).
Evaluation: Achieved 0.80 accuracy .

## Future Improvements
Try different models (Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost)
Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
